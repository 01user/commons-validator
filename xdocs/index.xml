      <p>
        A common issue when receiving data either electronically or from 
        user input is verifying the integrity of the data. This work is 
        repetitive and becomes even more complicated when different sets 
        of validation rules need to be applied to the same set of data based 
        on locale for example. Error messages may also vary by locale.  
        This package attempts to address some of these issues and 
        speed development and maintenance of validation rules.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to use the Validator, the following basic steps are required:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Create a new instance of the
            <code>org.apache.commons.validator.Validator</code> class. Currently
            Validator instances may be safely reused if the current
            ValidatorResources are the same, as long as you have completed any
            previous validation, and you do not try to utilize a particular
            Validator instance from more than one thread at a time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add any resources needed to perform the validations, such as the
            JavaBean to validate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Call the validate method on
            <code>org.apache.commons.validator.Validator</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
