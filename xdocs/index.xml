     This is an Internet protocol suite Java library originally developed by ORO, Inc.  
     The purpose of the library is to provide fundamental protocol 
     access, not higher-level abstractions. Therefore, some of the 
     design violates object-oriented design principles. Our philosophy 
     is to make the global functionality of a protocal accesible (e.g., 
     TFTP send file and receive file) when possible, but also provide 
     access to the fundamental protocols where applicable so that the 
     programmer may construct his own custom implementations (e.g, the 
     TFTP packet classes and the TFTP packet send and receive methods 
     are exposed).

    NetComponents was originally a commercial product, 
    but after ORO dissolved, it was continued to be made available for 
    those who found it useful. However, no updates have been made since 
    version 1.3.8, released in 1998. Now that certain contract obligations 
    have expired, it is possible to make the source code freely available 
    under the The Apache Software License.
