        The following is a list of items that need to be completed in
        Validator.  Contributions are welcome!

      <ul>
      	<li>
      		Change the validation.xml file semantics to match a more general "bean" validation usage.
      		Currently, the &lt;form-validation&gt;, &lt;formset&gt;, &lt;form&gt;, and &lt;field&gt; elements
      		require a form-centric view of validations.  Changing these to &lt;bean-validation&gt;, &lt;beans&gt;,
      		&lt;bean&gt;, and &lt;property&gt; respectively would allow Validator to be used more easily in
      		non-form based environments.
      	</li>
      	<li>
      		Replace the Jakarta ORO regex engine with the standard Java 1.4 engine.  Preliminary tests show a 
      		50% speed improvement using the standard engine.  This will remove the ORO dependency and
      		bring Validator in line with standard Java regular expressions.  However, this requires a move
      		to Java 1.4 as the base required Java version.  A good time for this move may be Validator 2.0 when
      		we also change the configuration file semantics.
