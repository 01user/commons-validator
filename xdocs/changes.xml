    <release version="1.0.1" date="In CVS">
      <action dev="dfs" type="update">
        Changed package private NNTP._reader and NNTP._writer member
        variables to protected NNTP._reader_ and NNTP._writer_
        variables as suggested by issue report 16995 to facilitate
        extending NNTPClient functionality in subclasses.
      </action>
      <action dev="dfs" type="update">
        Changed name of FTPClient.__openDataConnection() to
        FTPClient._openDataConnection_() to remain consistent
        with the convention in the code that protected members
        are of the form _foo_.  At some point __openDataConnection()
        had been changed from private to protected.

      <action dev="brekke" type="fix">
        Moved the ftp2 tree with tests to a proposal directory and setup 
        a build for that code.  This can grow in this area so users don't 
        think it is production ready.

      <action dev="dfs" type="fix">
        Patch for restarting FTP file transfers.  The offset was not
        being sent immediately before the data transfer command on
        account.  The bug was apparently introduced in NetComponents
        when it was decided to always send a PORT command before each data 
        transfer to avoid socket reuse problems on Windows.  
        From: Tapan Karecha ( tapan@india.hp.com ).

      <action dev="dfs" type="fix">
        Applied a fix for potential deadlock in TelnetInputStream by
        changing a wait() to a wait(100).
        From: Tapan Karecha ( tapan@india.hp.com ).
