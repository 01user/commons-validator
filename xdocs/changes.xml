        Patch for restarting FTP file transfers.  The offset was not
        being sent immediately before the data transfer command on
        account.  The bug was apparently introduced in NetComponents
        when it was decided to always send a PORT command before each data 
        transfer to avoid socket reuse problems on Windows.
