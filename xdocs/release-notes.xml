      <li><b>brekke</b> -- Added a migration document for moving from NetComponents to Commons/Net.</li>
      <li><b>brekke</b> -- Moved the ftp2 tree with tests to a proposal directory and setup a build for that code.  This can grow in this area so users don't think it is production ready.</li>
      <li><b>dfs</b> -- Cleaned up license header on some source.</li>
      <li><b>dfs</b> -- Moved .io and .util to .net.io and .net.util in preparation for 1.0 release.</li>
      <li><b>dfs</b> -- Fixed typo in NNTP.removeProtocolCommandListener() method name.  It was missing an L.  From joev@atg.com</li>
      <li><b>brekke</b> -- Various site updates including this changes doc and publish date information.</li>
      <li><b>dfs</b> -- Patch for restarting FTP file transfers.  The offset was not being sent immediately before the data transfer command on account.  The bug was apparently introduced in NetComponents when it was decided to always send a PORT command before each data transfer to avoid socket reuse problems on Windows.  From Tapan Karecha.</li>
      <li><b>dfs</b> -- Applied a fix for potential deadlock in TelnetInputStream by changing a wait() to a wait(100).  From Tapan Karecha.</li>
      <li><b>dfs</b> -- FTP examples now use passive ftp connections.</li>
