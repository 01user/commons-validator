o Building

To build, you must have ant and maven installed.  Just type 'ant' -- the default
target will compile the classes, run the tests and build the jar

Maven can be downloaded from the main site and there is good documentation
on the targets for building and installation instructions:

http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/maven

o Documentation

You can build the documentation with:

ant maven:site
